Installation Instructions
=========================

These instructions are preliminary and haven't been well tested. There are 
likely to be other package requirements that will show when installing.

Windows
=======

The PVSim.exe binary is self-contained, though to build it from source you will
first need to download and install these packages ('x' may be anything):

Python-2.7.x.msi                      http://www.python.org/download/releases/
wxPython-2.9-win32-2.9.x.x-py26.exe   http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/
gcc-mingw-4.x.x-setup.exe             http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files
pyinstaller-2.0.zip                   http://www.pyinstaller.org

Now go into the pvsim directory (containing this file), and type:

    winbuild

This should compile, link, and install the 'pvsimu' Python extension. To build and
test the command-line version of the pvsimu backend, type:

    cd src
    winmake
    cd ..
    cd test
    python pvsim_test.py
    cd ..

The final message should say "0 errors total".

In the pvsim directory type:

    winpack

This should build the stand-alone dist\PVSim.exe.


Linux
=====

Packages required (these are the versions I tested under Fedora 8, Linux 2.6.26,
installed using its package manager, others are likely to work):

python-2.5.1
wxPython-2.8.9.1

To build, you should be able to just type 'make' in the pvsim directory. If
your python was installed as root, you'll need to edit the Makefile and change
"SUDO =" to "SUDO = sudo" for the Linux case.

To run, type (or configure a task-panel launcher for it):

    ./pvsim.py

To run the test suite, type:

    make testu

The final message should say "0 errors total".


Mac OSX
=======

The PVSim.app binary is self-contained, though to build it from source you will
first need to download and install these packages (these are some versions
tested-- others may work. Python may already be installed):

xargs brew install < requirements_brew.txt
pip install -r requirements_pip.txt

To build dist/PVSim.app, type 'make' in the pvsim directory.

To run, double-click PVSim.app.
